-Font-display => Defines what to do while the font is being downloaded
    -block => HIDE the text until the font is downloaded 
    -fallback => FALLBACK to another font until the font is downloaded
    -optional => If font is downloaded fast, it will be shown, but if not, it will be downloaded in background
                    and cached in storage. In the next load, it will be loaded.
-To reduce 'Flash of Unstyled Text' =>
    -Use font-display -> OPTIONAL
    -Use Expert optimization in Webfont Generator and choose only the chracter types and languages that we use.
    -Use a SYSTEM FONT STACK
-In link elements, the property "rel=preconnect" allow the site to connect at soon as possible to a webpage to download
    the contents of it faster.
-Sizing Fonts => 
    -Avoid using PX -> differences in several devices.
    -In HTML -> Declare font-size to 62.5% -> the 62.5% of 16px (default) is 10px. So calculations in REM are easier.
    -Relative units ->
        -rem -> x times font size of root element (html)
-Law of Proximity -> Objects that are closer are perceived to be related.
-Vertical Spacing => 
    -margin 
    -line-height -> 1.5% the font size => 
        -If the value has NOT a unit -> It'll be used as a multiplier to the font size -> Use 1.5 directly
-Horizontal Spacing =>
    -letter-spacing
    -word-spacing
    -width
-Ideal line length => 50-70 characters
    -To archive this => For P elements => define width to 50ch
        -ch => relative to the width of the 0 character => 50 0s
-Formatting text => 
    -text-align
    -text-indent
    -text-decoration
    -text-transform
    -white-space
    -column-*
    -direction
-Truncating text =>
    -Set a fixed WIDTH
    -Set WHITE-SPACE to nowrap
    -Set OVERFLOW to hidden
    -Set TEXT-OVERFLOW to ellipsis
