-2 types of images => 
    -Raster -> PIXELS
        -Cameras/Scanners
        -JPG | PNG | GIF
        -Large image => More Pixels => Large file size
        -Blurry if scaled up
        -JPEG does not support animations nor transparency.
    -Vector -> Maths
        -Software
        -SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
        -Sharp at any size
-2 ways to set images => 
    -Content Images
        -Decoration purpose
    -Background Images
        -Added by CSS
-Reduce HTTP requests =>
    -CSS Sprites
        -No scalable.
    -Data URLs
        -Insert a long string starting with "data" instead of "http:".
        -They comes from the memory.
        -Size of embedded code is BIGGER than size of http image.
        -Increase complexity.
        -Slow on mobile devices.
-Clipping images
    -clip-path -> Shapes and values for clipping.
-Filters
    -We can insert multiple filters.
    -greyscale(70%) blur(3px)
-High-density Screens
    -Device's terms => 
        -Physical Resolution -> Actual number of pixels on the device.
        -Logical Resolution -> How they behave (CSS applies here)
        -Device Pixel Ratio (DPR) -> Ratio of Physical to Logical resolution.
        -High Density -> DPR > 1
    -Generally, the Scale factor (DPR) of these devices are bigger (2x, +). 
        -Images will be scaled up and will be shown blurry.
    -To get the 1x, 2x, 3x version from an image => Use Photoshop.  
        -Always start with the bigger resolutions.
    -Compression standard => Quality 7 (Photoshop)
    -'srcset' attribute for img elements ->
        -srcset="images/x.jpg 1x, 
                 images/x@2x.jpg 2x,
                 images/x@3x.jpg 3x,"
